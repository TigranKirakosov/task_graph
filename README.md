# An Action Orchestrator

A declarative DSL for composing hierarchical execution graphs in Rust.

`action-orc` provides a straightforward framework to model and drive high-level app control flows:
- Document execution actions in a static, yet composable graph notation
- Define event resolvers to map custom app logic to designated actions
- Drive action transitions within a customizable, reactive network

## Planned Features
- [x] fluent and complete [DSL](DSL.md):
    - [x] IDE support
    - [x] compilation error spans
    - [x] compile-time detection of circular dependencies
- [ ] control directives:
    - [ ] [*race*](DSL.md#race)
    - [ ] [*fallback*](DSL.md#fallback)
- [ ] graph visualizer

## Planned Integrations
- [ ] [Bevy plugin](TODO: put link to plugin crate)

## Syntax Overview
> Declare your battle formations with the `orc!` macro, and let the Warchief lead the horde to victory!

- Declare nodes: bind handles (`node: Marker`) or match anonymously (`Marker`)
- Map dependencies: `lhs -> rhs` (i.e., **lhs** blocks **rhs**)
- Bind already declared nodes: `[b] -> y`
- Compose graphs: dynamically embed sub-graphs (`A -> #[sub] -> B`)
- Group nodes into ordered *Sequences* or *Parallel* branches:
    - Sequence block: `(a, b, c)`
    - Parallel block: `(x | y | z)`

```rust
use action_orc::*;

fn warchief_campaign(reinforce: &Graph) -> Graph {
    orc! {
        // Define first timeline
        BuildCamp -> (
            gather: GatherResources,
            // make #[reinforce] dependant on upstream nodes
            (Defend | RequestReinforcements) -> #[reinforce],
        );
    
        // Define second parallel timline, linked with the first one by [gather] and #[reinforce] nodes
        prepare: PrepareCampaign -> (
            [gather] -> BuildWarmachines
            | TrainGrunts
            | #[reinforce], // make this timline dependant on #[reinforce] aswell
        );
        
        // Declare exit node
        victory: CelebrateVictory;

        // Define path to exit
        [prepare] -> AssembleArmy -> LaunchCampaign -> [victory];
    }
}
```
